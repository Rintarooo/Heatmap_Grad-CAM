## Visualization for VGG16 model
You can see which parts of an image VGG16 model was seeing for predicting

Blended an image from ImageNet and a heatmap

You can change a blending percentage in GUI using a bar

If you want to try a different image, you should download images from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) and save them in image_dir, then change <img_path> in main.py

## Usage
Execute using following command

≠≠≠python main.py≠≠≠
